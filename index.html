      <p>
          My name in Daria. I was born in Siberia (yes it is very cold in
          there, it is about -25-30F in winter). I lived in the north of
          China for awhile, and then went to college in Russian Far East(
          !Fun fact! my school's campus is on an island, and there is
          nothing else besides the campus on this island). </p>

      <p>I lived in
          Shanghai for about year and a half, and was an exchange student at
          Fudan university. I have a degree in Internation Relations and
          Diplomacy. I moved to US at the end of 2015, and studied Business
          and Accounting in UCLA Extension.</p>

      <p>Right now I work for an
          accounting firm in Westwood. We do business management,
          accounting, bokkeeping, and taxes. I have amazing co-workers but
          accounting was never my passion so hopefully after the Bootcamp I
          will be able to find a job that I will be more passionate about.</p>
